        <h3>Welcome to my page!</h3>
        <p>Hey there, I'm Kaitlyn, an aspiring web developer. I live in Columbus, Indiana with my dog / motivational
          coach, Dodge. If you can't find Columbus on a map don't worry! It's a small town about an hour south of
          Indianapolis, known for it's architecture.

        <p>Currently, I'm working at an engine manufacturing company as an electronic hardware integration engineer. I'm
          a creative, hardworking individual who's always looking for the next challenge, and I would love to work with
          you on your future projects. Scroll down to learn more about me!</p>

        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I started off my professional life as a mechanical engineer and then felt the pull to take my career in
          another direction. Ultimately, I found myself drawn to software engineering and am excited to begin this new
          journey.</p>
        <p>I'm passionate about working on projects that will improve others' lives, and I believe as a developer, I can
          make that happen. I've had prior experience learning to code during my undergraduate classes and really
          enjoyed the process of writing code, testing code, and debugging. I'm a very detail oriented person and
          extremely self-motivated, which aligns well with the work of software engineer. </p>
        <p>I'm excited about becoming a developer because I've always had an unsatiable appetite to learn new things,
          I'm a logical thinker who loves solving puzzles, and I enjoy creating and building things from scratch.</p>

        <h3>Fun Facts</h3>
        <p>Those who know me, would describe me as a crazy, dog mom. I'm a huge animal and nature lover, and enjoy
          spending most of my time outdoors. I love a good cup of coffee and catching up with friends. I'm also a big
          fan of live music and summer concerts. Outside of work you can find me hiking with my dog, learning how to
          dance at my local studio, or starting on my next craft project!</p>

        <h3>Team Player</h3>
        <p>I've always been the person on a team project who acts as the "glue" to keep everyone on track and motivated.
          I get value from helping and training others, which makes working with a team very rewarding to me. My current
          job has taught me the importance of working with a diverse, cross-functional team in order to deliver the best
          product. As an introvert, I can be independent at times, but will always step up and do my part when I'm
          working with a group.
