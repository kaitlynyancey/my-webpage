    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I started off my professional life as a mechanical engineer and then felt the pull to take my career in another direction. Ultimately, I found myself drawn to software engineering and am excited to begin this new journey. I'm passionate about working on projects that will improve others' lives, and I believe as a developer, I can make that happen. I've had prior experience learning to code during my undergraduate classes and really enjoyed the process of writing code, testing code, and debugging. I'm a very detail oriented person and extremely self-motivated, which aligns well with the work of software engineer. </p>

    <h3>Team Player</h3>
    <p>
      I've always been the person on a team project who acts as the "glue" to keep everyone on track and motivated. I get value from helping and training others, which makes working with a team very rewarding to me. My current job has taught me the importance of working with a diverse, cross-functional team in order to deliver the best product. As an introvert, I can be independent at times, but will always step up and do my part when I'm working with a group.
